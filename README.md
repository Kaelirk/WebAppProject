 ## An application designed for physiotherapists and patients allowing them to schedule and management appointments online.

 This application was built as part of the International University's DLBCSPJDW01 web development project. The application is designed to allow users to do the following:

 * Request appointments with healthcare professionals via an online agenda
 * Manage appointments through an online agenda
 * Keep track of previous appointments
 * Find information regarding reimbursements for healthcare bills
 
 In future, the application will also include:

 * Lists of therapists based on name/location/profession
 * A better calendar system (likely via fullcalendar)
 * The ability for healthcare professionals to view patient profiles
 * The ability for patients to view healthcare professional profiles
 * A simple double click installer.exe with start and stop buttons so non-code familiar users can avoid needing to use docker commands.
